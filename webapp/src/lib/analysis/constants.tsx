  images: { low: "Product imagery is insufficient. 56% of users explore images before reading anything", mid: "Image gallery lacks variety. Missing lifestyle, scale, or texture shots" },
  socialProof: { low: "No visible reviews. Going from 0 to 5 reviews delivers a 270% conversion lift", mid: "Social proof present but poorly positioned. UGC photo reviews drive 144-161% higher conversion" },
  checkout: { low: "Checkout options are limited. Shop Pay alone lifts conversion up to 50%", mid: "Payment options could be expanded. BNPL increases conversion 35% on higher-ticket items" },
  mobileCta: { low: "CTA is hidden or broken on mobile. 77% of traffic is mobile but converts at half the desktop rate", mid: "Mobile CTA could be more prominent. Sticky add-to-cart buttons are non-negotiable" },
  title: { low: "Product title fails to communicate value or include key search terms", mid: "Title misses SEO opportunities. Primary keyword should be in the first 3-5 words" },
  aiDiscoverability: { low: "Page is invisible to AI shopping. AI-referred traffic converts at 14.2% vs 2.8% from Google", mid: "AI discoverability could be improved. AI traffic to retail grew 4,700% YoY" },
  structuredData: { low: "Missing or broken schema markup. 65% of pages cited by Google AI Mode include structured data", mid: "Schema markup is incomplete. Rich snippets boost CTR up to 25%" },
  pricing: { low: "Price presentation creates friction. No anchoring, no compare-at price, no installment framing", mid: "Pricing psychology underutilized. Charm pricing and anchoring shift conversion measurably" },
  description: { low: "Description fails to sell. 78% of sites don't structure by highlights", mid: "Description needs better structure and benefit focus" },
  shipping: { low: "Hidden shipping costs cause 48% of all cart abandonment", mid: "Shipping info is vague. Concrete delivery dates outperform estimates. 41% of sites fail here" },
  crossSell: { low: "No cross-sell or upsell strategy. AI recommendations can increase AOV by 18.65%", mid: "Cross-sell present but not optimized. Show 4-6 recommendations near the buy section" },
  trust: { low: "No trust signals visible. Visible phone numbers are the #1 global trust symbol", mid: "Trust elements present but not prominently displayed" },
  socialCommerce: { low: "No social commerce integration. TikTok Shop drives 3-5x higher conversion than static listings", mid: "Social commerce is underutilized. Pinterest Rich Pins increase CTR 39%" },
  sizeGuide: { low: "No size guide. 30-40% of clothing returns are size-related", mid: "Size info could be more interactive. Fit finders dramatically outperform static charts" },
  variantUx: { low: "Variant selection is confusing. Color swatches outperform dropdowns for visual products", mid: "Variant UX could improve. Low-stock warnings reduce abandonment by 8%" },
  accessibility: { low: "Accessibility issues detected. 4,500+ lawsuits filed in 2024, up 37% in 2025", mid: "Some accessibility gaps. 54% of Shopify stores fail color contrast" },
  contentFreshness: { low: "Content appears stale. Outdated badges and certifications erode trust", mid: "Content could be fresher. Regular updates signal relevance to search engines and AI" },
