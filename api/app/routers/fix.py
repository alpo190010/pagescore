"""``GET /fix/{dimension_key}`` — structured fix content for a store-wide dimension.

Tier gating (DOM-safe — locked fields are never sent):

  * ``fixes`` tier ($149/yr) sees everything: label, problem,
    revenue_gain, effort, scope, steps, code.
  * ``insights`` tier ($79/yr) sees the diagnostic prose (problem,
    scope) but ``steps=[]`` and ``code=null``. ``recommendationsLocked=True``.
  * ``free`` / anonymous see ``label``, ``revenue_gain``, ``effort`` —
    these are headline metrics meant to advertise the unlock. Premium
    diagnostic prose (``problem``, ``scope``) is ``None`` and the
    fix content (``steps``, ``code``) is empty/null. ``detailsLocked=True``.

When ``?domain=`` is provided and the caller is authenticated, the step
list is filtered against that store's latest scan signals so only the
actions that actually apply are shown. Without ``domain`` the generic
(worst-case) step list is returned for backward compatibility.
