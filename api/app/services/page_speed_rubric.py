"""Scoring rubric and tip selector for page speed signals.

Converts :class:`PageSpeedSignals` into a deterministic 0–100 score
using weighted criteria derived from Google Web Vitals, Deloitte,
Amazon latency research, and Shopify theme performance benchmarks,
and selects up to 3 prioritised improvement tips.

Two scoring paths are used depending on whether PageSpeed Insights
API data is available (Path A) or only HTML-derived signals exist
(Path B).
