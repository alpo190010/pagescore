"""Credit entitlement service — pure functions for credit checking, usage
incrementing, and free-tier monthly reset.

This is the business logic layer that downstream routes wire in as a
Depends() guard (e.g. /analyze in S03).

Race-safety note:
The direct attribute approach (user.credits_used += 1) is sufficient for
the free tier (max 3 credits).  A concurrent request could theoretically
double-reset, but that's harmless (resetting 0 to 0).  Paid-tier resets
are handled atomically by webhooks in S02.
