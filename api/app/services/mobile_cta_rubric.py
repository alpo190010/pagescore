"""Scoring rubric and tip selector for mobile CTA & UX signals.

Converts :class:`MobileCtaSignals` into a deterministic 0-100 score
using weighted criteria derived from Growth Rock, Baymard Institute,
Apple HIG, WCAG 2.5.5, Steven Hoober thumb-zone research, and
Contentsquare traffic data, and selects up to 3 prioritised tips.

Two scoring tiers:
  - HTML-only (Playwright measurements unavailable): max ~65/100
  - Full Playwright measurements: max 100/100
